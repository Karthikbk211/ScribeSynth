# ScribeSynth

A one-shot handwriting generation model trained on the IAM Handwriting Database (word-level). Given a single handwriting sample from a writer, ScribeSynth generates realistic handwriting in that writer's style for any input text.

---

## Overview

ScribeSynth is inspired by one-shot diffusion based handwriting generation. It extends existing approaches with:

- **Extended sequence architecture** — supports up to 32 characters (vs 9 in One-DM), designed to scale beyond word-level generation
- **Learnable high-frequency filter** — replaces the fixed Laplacian kernel with a trainable CNN that learns what stroke details are most useful for style capture
- **Style confidence score** — outputs a confidence score indicating how well the generated handwriting matches the input style
- **IAM dataset support** — trained on the IAM Handwriting Database (word-level crops)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karthikbk211/ScribeSynth.git
cd ScribeSynth
```

### 2. Create the environment

Open **Anaconda Prompt** and run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate scribesynth
```

### 3. Download the IAM Handwriting Database

The IAM dataset is available on Kaggle:

> [IAM Handwriting Database — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nibinv23/iam-handwriting-word-database)

After downloading and extracting, organize the data as follows:

```
data/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   │   └── <writer_id>/
│   │       └── <image>.png
│   └── test/
│       └── <writer_id>/
│           └── <image>.png
├── style/
│   ├── train/
│   └── test/
├── freq/
│   ├── train/
│   └── test/
├── IAM_train.txt
└── IAM_test.txt
```

Each line in `IAM_train.txt` / `IAM_test.txt` should follow the format:
```
<writer_id>,<image_name> <transcription>
```

### 4. Pretrained VAE

The model uses the VAE from Stable Diffusion v1.5. It is downloaded automatically when you run `train.py` (requires a stable internet connection):

```bash
# downloaded automatically from huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5
```

## Training

> **Note:** Use `python -m torch.distributed.run` instead of `torchrun` — `torchrun` may fail on some Windows/Anaconda setups.

### Stage 1 — Train from scratch

Open **Anaconda Prompt**, activate the environment, then run:

```bash
conda activate scribesynth

python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=1 train.py ^
    --cfg configs/IAM_scratch.yml ^
    --device cuda
```

### Resume from checkpoint

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=1 train.py ^
    --cfg configs/IAM_scratch.yml ^
    --resume checkpoints/scribesynth_step155000.pth ^
    --device cuda
```

### Stage 2 — Fine-tune with recognition loss

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=1 train_finetune.py ^
    --cfg configs/IAM_finetune.yml ^
    --pretrained checkpoints/scribesynth_step200000.pth ^
    --ocr_model model_zoo/text_recognizer.pth ^
    --device cuda
```

---

## Generation

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=1 test.py ^
    --cfg configs/IAM_scratch.yml ^
    --pretrained checkpoints/scribesynth_final.pth ^
    --generate_type iv_s ^
    --sample_method ddim ^
    --dir Generated
```

Generation types:
- `iv_s` — in-vocabulary, seen writers
- `iv_u` — in-vocabulary, unseen writers
- `oov_s` — out-of-vocabulary, seen writers
- `oov_u` — out-of-vocabulary, unseen writers

---

## How It Works

1. **Style encoding** — a handwriting sample from the writer is passed through a ResNet18 encoder. One branch captures low-frequency style (overall slant, weight, spacing) and the other captures high-frequency details (stroke edges, curves) through a learnable frequency filter.

2. **Content encoding** — the desired text is rendered as unifont bitmap images and encoded through a ResNet18.

3. **Style-content fusion** — a transformer decoder fuses the content with style features in two stages — first low frequency, then high frequency. A confidence head (MLP 256→128→1) outputs a style confidence score.

4. **Diffusion generation** — the fused style-content context guides a UNet to denoise a random latent into a clean handwriting image over 50 DDIM steps.

5. **VAE decoding** — the clean latent is decoded by a frozen VAE into the final handwriting image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- PyTorch 2.0.1
- CUDA 11.7
- 8GB+ GPU VRAM minimum (tested on NVIDIA RTX 4060 8GB)
- Recommended: set `IMS_PER_BATCH: 2` in config for 8GB GPUs
